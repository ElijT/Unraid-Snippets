Try manually unmounting disks

umount /mnt/diskmount
(where diskmount could be diskX and X is the number assigned, or diskmount is cache).

If that doesn't work you can try:

umount -l /mnt/diskmount
The -l is for a lazy unmount - this can lead to data loss.

Before lazy unmounting it is highly recommend trying to determine what's keeping the file system mounted with something like:

lsof 2>/dev/null | grep /mnt

Midnight Commander is often the cullprit here
